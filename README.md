🔍 Abstract

This repository introduces a novel protein folding engine based on Motion = Being Theory (MBT), a physics-based model that redefines biological curvature, resonance, and bonding as dynamic expressions of motion across structured quantum layers. Unlike traditional force-field or AI-black-box approaches, the MBT engine simulates folding through resistance curves, symbolic memory, and curvature alignment—enabling a transparent, interpretable mechanism for understanding protein behavior and misfolding disorders.




💡 Core Concepts

Curvature-Based Folding:
Proteins are not pushed or pulled into shape—they settle into curvature minima defined by motion-resistance dynamics in MBT. This replaces force vectors with wave interference and energy wells.
Symbolic Field Resonance:
Amino acids and peptide chains are modeled as dynamic curvature glyphs with recursive symbolic resonance fields. Bonds form not by attraction but by memory-lock alignment and curvature binding.
MBT Mass Gap Simulation:
Uses the same mathematical engine as MBT’s Yang–Mills mass gap solution, ensuring that energy confinement and damping align with known folding thermodynamics.



🧪 Implementation Overview





The codebase contains:



protein_curvature_engine.py: Core simulation logic using MBT curvature and damping rules
curvature_wave_simulation.py: Visualizes folding via resistance-based curvature motion
mbt_mass_gap_wave.py: Demonstrates energy localization consistent with known stable protein folds




The system can simulate:



Normal folding patterns
Folding failure scenarios (e.g. prion-like behavior)
Mutation-induced curvature disruption



🧬 Potential Use Cases





Folding analysis and prediction
Drug target alignment based on curvature translation
Curvature-aware mutation diagnostics
Alternative to AI-trained black box models



📈 Why MBT Matters



The MBT engine:



Makes folding interpretable
Operates from first principles
Integrates physics and biology seamlessly




It’s built not to replace protein datasets, but to explain them. It offers a human-understandable system that aligns curvature mechanics with observable biological outcomes.
